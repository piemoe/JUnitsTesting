# JUnitsTesting

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Test it. Rigorously. This applies to anything that gets developed, any product or service *needs* to be tested. You may think your product is functional as you develop it, but you won't know until it goes through some line of testing. To test if a product functions, test its use. What happens when you try to use the product as a normal user who may not know the rules? To test a product's security, test its limits. Throw cases at it that are designed to be extraordinary and, if you're so inclined, hostile. After all, it's better to test your product or service yourself and fix the errors and exploits before launch when a less-cooperative and less-forthcoming party may find them instead.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understand who you're designing for. In my contact module I have uploaded, it is a fairly lightweight bit intended to be plugged into a larger product. It's just supposed to capture names and phone numbers for something else to manage. That's all it needs to do, and for it to do anything more at the moment would fall under "scope creep" where extra features are added because they sound nice. However, if it turns out that users need more functionality in the contacts, say the ability to assign them to groups, that can be incorporated into the scope.

## How do I approach designing software?
Make something that works. Once it works, make it work better, and make sure it meets the requirements. Once it does, then make sure it does under expectable loads and conditions. If there's still time and resources, get it to work under unexpected conditions.
